<p>For shipping to the Netherlands, we apply two different rates, depending on the total order amount. The shipping costs are the same for all payment methods.<br />
All packages are insured and shipped with signature.</p>

<p><br />
Why no free shipping?<br />
This is very simple: the costs incurred for sending (PostNL unfortunately sends charge) must be paid in one way or another. Most retailers calculate these costs as a sort of storage in the selling price of the products. We can make our products best all slightly more expensive and thus pretend we do not charge shipping costs - as usually happens with other merchants.</p>

<p>This, however, we find unfair since it allows customers who buy multiple items are thus penalized because there are calculated so basically double shipping to them.</p>

<p>The merchants therefore do not charge shipping, so make it through without you have the \ &#39;free shipping \&#39; .........<br />
We keep costs rather open and honest!<br />
